<h2>
How It's Made:
</h2>

<p>
Tech Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

Upon opening the site page a joke setup automatically appears on the screen.  To get the punchline,
users must click the "???" button below the joke setup phrase.  This will cause the punchline to arrear 
under the cicked button.  to get a new joke, refresh the page.  This was one of my first API projects 
that illustrates core concepts like fetch requests, query selectors,  and button usage.
