<h1>Simple Calculator</h1>

<p>
This program performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It has a simple interface with buttons for numbers and operators, and a display screen that shows the 
results of calculations.

<h2>
How It's Made:
</h2>

<p>
This project is more HTML based, using table syntax.  Each table contains three numbers and a arithmetic
operator, except fr the finsl row which holds zero, the decimal operator, the calculate function and the 
divide operator. Each row input is given a 'onclick' method used to display the value of the button in the 
display window. The calculate function accepts the value of the HTML input in order to preform the 
calculation.   These values are stored in a variable 'solution' within a calculate function.

<h2>
Lessons Learned:
</h2>

<p>
This project uses semantic HTML to arrange the calculator content into table rows and columns.  An onclick
method was added the the HTML input tag which was used in the JavaScript portion of the project and 
used within the clear function, display function, and calculate function to provide functionality tyo the calculator.  
The clear function empties the display windiow, display adds the numbers and operators to the display window,
and calculate function uses the values and operators to calculate solutions and display the result in the display window.
